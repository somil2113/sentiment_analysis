Preprocessing raw text data (removing stopwords, punctuation, and more).  
Training a machine learning model (Logistic Regression) for sentiment classification.  
Testing the modelâ€™s performance on unseen data.  
A user-friendly interface to input custom reviews for real-time sentiment prediction.
